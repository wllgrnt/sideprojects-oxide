Step 1: Learn Rust - http://rustbyexample.com/
                   - https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
                   
Step 2: Decide what to make! (It's probs a visualisation tool, using the Glium OpenGL wrapper).

Steps to making a visualiser:

1) Write the OpenGL to render a sphere.
2) Write the Rust to load in a file and get (for now) the (x,y,z) coordinates.
3) Render a sphere at each one of those coordinates.
4) Iterate and improve

### Personal to-dos

#### wpg

#### mj

* Write 3d OpenGL... I've done it before, it's just a case of Rustifying it (and remembering it, since I'm on a different laptop...)

#### mle

* Write interface with some crystal file formats to plot shapes at the right coordinates
